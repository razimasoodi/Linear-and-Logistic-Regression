# Linear-and-Logistic-Regression
Part A: Linear Regression

Dataset: Data-Train, Data-Test

Linear regression tries to model the relationship between two variables by applying a linear equation to a series of data. Your task is to train linear model on the given datasets.
Implement linear regression using closed form solution and the Gradient Descent algorithm (Batch or Stochastic, only one) and test your implementation on the given Test Dataset.
• Use the Data-Train to train your model, and test on the Data-Test.
• Plot of the datasets and regression lines.
• Plot cost function for enough iteration for linear regression in Gradient Descent (Batch or stochastic, only one).
• Report the learned parameters (θ0, θ1, ..., θn), and also the value of MSE error on the train and test data.



Part B: Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

Dataset: Iris https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

• The Iris dataset consists of 4 features and 3 classes. Use only the first and second
features (remove the third and fourth columns) and also delete the instances of the
’Iris-versicolor’ class to reduce the data to 2 classes with 2 features.
• Consider the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test
• Report the training and testing errors, and the equation of the decision boundary.
• Also, plot the decision boundary along with the samples of the two classes with different
colors all in one plot.
